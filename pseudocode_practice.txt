Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number
  PRINT first number
ELSE 
  PRINT second number


Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

SET increment to 1
SET index to 1
SET max to 100
FOR each number at index, from index to max
  PRINT number at index
  THEN increment + index

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT phonebook entries as an object
INPUT desired entry
FOR each entry in phonebook entries
 IF phonebook entry is equal to desired entry
   RETURN phone book entry

Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

in JavaScript: 

function matchEntry( desiredEntry, phonebook ) {
 let match = phonebook.filter(entry => entry===desiredEntry);
 return match;
}
