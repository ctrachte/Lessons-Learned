What is a hash table?
A data structure that contains values each attached to a unique hash key.

What is hashing?
Hashing is generating a unique value or values from a string of text using a mathematical function.

How does a hash table store data?
By sorting data into 'buckets' that each have a unique key.

How are hash tables and objects different?
An object can refer to any set of key/value pairs.
A Hash table is one implementation of the key/value pair paradigm where values are converted to unique hash codes in order to index them.
A hash table can never have two values at the same index.

Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:

A list of pets and their unique names.
- object

The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend.

object

The name and location of every company in a given city.

hash table

All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual.

hash table

object


Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.

**Using pseudocode, because I have never built a hash table with any language and have not been given syntax or instructions in this lesson on how to.**

CREATE table HashClient;
createClient(name,phone,address);
searchClients(HashClient,phone);

function createClient(name, phone, address){
  STORE name, address into HashClient and associate with phone number (value)
}

function searchClients(HashClient, phone) {
 SEARCH HashClient for bucket associated with phone;
 RETURN bucket;
}

Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.

CREATE table HashInventory;
scanItem(HashInventory,BarcodeId);

function scanItem(HashInventory,BarcodeId){
  IF
   item barcode exists in HashInventory, update QTY value in hashInventory for this barcode value;
  ELSE
   STORE each item's values (name, descp, exp date, price) into hashInventory and associate with barcode value;
}

Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.

CREATE table HashPublisher;
CREATE table HashDate;

addArticle(article);
findArticle(article);

function addArticle(newspaper){
  STORE article name, date, content (etc) into HashPublisher and associate with publisher (value);
  STORE article name, date, content (etc) into HashDate and associate with date (value);
}

function findArticle (HashPublisher, HashDate, keyword) {
 IF keyword is date
  SEARCH HashDate for bucket associated with keyword;
   RETURN bucket;
 ELSE IF keyword is publisher
  SEARCH HashPublisher for keyword
   RETURN bucket;
 ELSE
  RETURN statement concerning no matches or possible typo
